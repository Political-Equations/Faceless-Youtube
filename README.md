# Political Equations FYC (Faceless YouTube Channel)

## Vision
This repository houses the core assets, documentation, and operational elements for the "Political Equations" faceless YouTube channel. The channel aims to dissect historical and contemporary political events through a unique analytical framework, blending deep political philosophy with a clear, symbolic visual language inspired by "modern hieroglyphs" and the aesthetics of physics/mathematical simulations.

Our goal is to make complex political dynamics understandable and engaging, revealing the underlying "equations" that govern political life.

## Core Components (Directory Structure)
* `/glyphs/`: Contains the SVG source files for our "modern hieroglyph" visual dictionary and the style guide.
* `/video-engine/`: Holds scripts, prompts for AI tools, and templates used in the video production pipeline.
* `/docs/`: Stores the master "Theory Document" (political philosophy and equations library), ontology lists, and other key project documentation.
* `/ops/`: Includes any automation scripts (e.g., GitHub Actions) for the project.

## Connection to Broader Ecosystem
The "Political Equations" YouTube channel and the analytical system developed here also serve as a foundation and audience-building platform for the future "Political Life" simulation game.
